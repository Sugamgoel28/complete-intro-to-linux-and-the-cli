For example, if you have a shell open, you're running bash as a process.</p>\n<p>Go ahead and run <code class=\"language-text\">ps</code> and see what it outputs. For me the list is pretty short because it's showing just what me, ubuntu, is running which isn't much. ps stands for processes snaphshot. To prove my point, try the following.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">sleep</span> <span class=\"token number\">10</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">ps</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>You'll notice now you'll have a sleep process running as well since you now own that process. So let's dissect a few things here. We'll get to what the <code class=\"language-text\">&amp;</code> means in a bit (it means run this in the background.) <code class=\"language-text\">sleep &lt;number></code> just makes a process that waits for <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;number></code> seconds and then exits. So <code class=\"language-text\">sleep 10</code> waits for ten seconds and then exits.</p>\n<p>Every process you run is assigned a process ID which everyone refers to as a pid. Every process is also owned by a user. Some processes will always be owned by root, others by whatever user you are, and others still. If you look at your ps output, you'll those random numbers next to what you're runnning. This is the pid.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you need to kill an in-flight process. You can do that by using <code class=\"language-text\">kill</code> and tell it what signal (same signals we were talking about earlier.) Let's try that.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">sleep</span> <span class=\"token number\">100</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">ps</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># find the sleep pid</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">kill</span> -s SIGKILL <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>the pid from above<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n<span class=\"token function\">ps</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># notice the process has been killed</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Note you'll frequently see <code class=\"language-text\">kill -s SIGKILL</code> as <code class=\"language-text\">kill -9</code>. They mean the same thing. There are other numbers but I never remember what they are so I just use <code class=\"language-text\">-s</code> for things like <code class=\"language-text\">SIGTERM</code>.</p>\n<p>So what else is your computer running right now? Try <code class=\"language-text\">ps aux</code>. This will show you everything running from everyone, including all system processes. It should be substantially longer. You'll see a few processes running by you, many from root, and a few from others like systemd+, daemon, and others. This list can be overwhelming so I'll frequently feed this into grep to find things I'm looking for. Try this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">ps</span> aux <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token function\">grep</span> <span class=\"token function\">ps</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>You'll notice the list is pared down to just things have <code class=\"language-text\">ps</code> in them (including the <code class=\"language-text\">grep</code> command itself)</p>\n<h2 id=\"foreground-and-background\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#foreground-and-background\" aria-label=\"foreground and background permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Foreground and Background</h2>\n<p>A process can either run in the foreground or the background. If something is running in the foreground, you'll see all the output and you will wait until it's finished. If it's running in the background, you can still see the output (unless you redirect it) but you can start doing other things. When you put the <code class=\"language-text\">&amp;</code> at the end it means \"I want this to run in the background\" (and hence why we've been using it before.)</p>\n<p>Go ahead and try <code class=\"language-text\">sleep 2 &amp;</code> to see this. After two or more seconds, hit enter again. Bash will let you know the job completed.</p>\n<p>Okay, so we see how to do that. What if we want to pause a currently running process? Try this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">sleep</span> <span class=\"token number\">100</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\"># hit CTRL + Z</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">jobs</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># notice process is stopped</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">bg</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># it's the first and only item in the list, the number refers to that</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">jobs</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># notice process is running</span>\n<span class=\"token function\">fg</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token comment\"># reattch to the process</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Notice you can run <code class=\"language-text\">jobs</code> with a <code class=\"language-text\">-l</code> if you need the pid to kill it.</p>\n<p>This is a great way to start and stop scripts and in particular if you have a long running task that you want to complete but don't want to wait and want to do other things. Do be aware that if you close your terminal however that it will kill all your running jobs. You'll need to use something like <a href=\"https://www.rackaid.com/blog/linux-screen-tutorial-and-how-to/\">screen</a> or <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/671422/how-to-use-tmux-on-linux-and-why-its-better-than-screen/\">tmux</a> to accomplish that and those are beyond the scope of this course (I don't frequently use them so I don't teach them.)</p>\n<p>So when would you do this? Maybe if you needed to install something that could take a while or run a script that does some cleanup. You need it to run but you don't need to watch it. These are all great cases to send tasks to the background.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/processes","title":"Processes","order":"6B","section":"Environments and Processes","description":"One of the core components of Linux is managing processes.
