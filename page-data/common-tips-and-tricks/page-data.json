If you type <code class=\"language-text\">cd ~</code> you'll go to your home directory.

When I say \"tab completion\" I mean you start typing something and hit the tab key, the shell will do its best to figure out what you're trying type. An example would be if I'm in a directory with two files, index.html and package.json, and I start typing <code class=\"language-text\">cat i</code> and hit tab, it will know the only file starting with <code class=\"language-text\">i</code> is index.html and will autocomplete your line to <code class=\"language-text\">cat index.html</code>. Saves you a lot of typing.</p>\n<p>For another example, imagine you have two files in a folder, index.html and index.js. If you start typing <code class=\"language-text\">cat</code> and hit tab, it'll complete out to <code class=\"language-text\">cat index.</code> because that's as far it can get without assuming which file you want to open. If you hit tab again, it should show you your two options. If you then hit <code class=\"language-text\">j</code> and hit tab it'll complete out <code class=\"language-text\">cat index.js</code> for you.</p>\n<p>Some commands are smart enough to know what sort of thing you're looking for. If you have two files, saved.txt and something-else.txt, and a folder called src, if you type <code class=\"language-text\">cd s</code> and hit tab, you'll autocomplete <code class=\"language-text\">cd src</code> because the shell knows you're looking for a folder when you're using <code class=\"language-text\">cd</code>.</p>\n<p>Tab completion will always work with the file system. Some commands have tab completion too. Type <code class=\"language-text\">git de</code> and hit tab and it should complete to <code class=\"language-text\">git describe</code> for example. Admittedly I use this far less because I can never remember which commands have tab completion and which don't. The individual programs have to supply that to the shell for it to work.</p>\n<h1 id=\"reverse-search\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#reverse-search\" aria-label=\"reverse search permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reverse Search</h1>\n<p>Instead of having to hit up a bunch of times to find a command you ran forever ago (it keeps track of something like the past 10K commands you've run), you can CTRL+R to do a reverse search (reverse meaning starting with the most recent and working background to most recent.)</p>\n<p>Let's say I ran the command <code class=\"language-text\">echo \"hello my friends\"</code> last week and I wanted to find that command again and I only remember that it had something to do with \"friends\". I'd type CTRL+R and start typing \"friends\". If it was the most recent command that I had run with \"friends\" in it, it'd show up and I could hit enter and it'd run. If there was another command between now and again, I can hit CTRL+R again to look further back in the history. This is also super useful and something I do a lot.</p>\n<h1 id=\"bash_history\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bash_history\" aria-label=\"bash_history permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>.bash_history</h1>\n<p>The previous two things are made possible by a file called <code class=\"language-text\">.bash_history</code>. This file is constantly being appended to when you run commands. You don't really need to ever really edit this file but I wanted you to be aware of where it was and what it does. It's always in your home (<code class=\"language-text\">~</code>) directory. If you're using another shell, it'll be called something else like <code class=\"language-text\">.zsh_history</code>.</p>\n<p>If you type <code class=\"language-text\">tail ~/.bash_history</code> you should see what the last few commands you've ran in your previous session of bash. It will only write to .bash_history once you've exited bash, it'll dump the whole session's commands into it.</p>\n<p>One reason I want you to be aware of it is that if you say something like <code class=\"language-text\">command --password=my_super_secret_password</code> that will live in your <code class=\"language-text\">.bash_history</code> file unless you delete it. That means if someone gets ahold of your computer, they could potentially nab passwords that way. Just something to keep in mind. You can also edit the <code class=\"language-text\">.bash_history</code> after you run a command like that to delete it and it'll be gone.</p>\n<h1 id=\"\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\" permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>!!</h1>\n<p>If you type <code class=\"language-text\">!!</code> in bash, it will replace the <code class=\"language-text\">!!</code> with whatever the last command you ran.

If you run <code class=\"language-text\">sudo !!</code> it'll re-run the same command again but with <code class=\"language-text\">sudo</code> in front (we'll talk about sudo soon.)</p>\n<p>\"!\" is often pronounced \"bang\" when it comes to the command line. When I looked at why, I found this on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark#History\">Wikipedia</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the 1950s, secretarial dictation and typesetting manuals in America referred to the mark as \"bang\", perhaps from comic books where the ! appeared in dialogue balloons to represent a gun being fired, although the nickname probably emerged from letterpress printing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, given that, you'll hear this frequently called \"bang bang\".</p>\n<h1 id=\"clear\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#clear\" aria-label=\"clear permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>clear</h1>\n<p>If your screen is too full, just type <code class=\"language-text\">clear</code> and enter and it'll put you back at the top.

CTRL+C and CTRL+V already mean something different to bash (they're signals, we'll talk about those shortly) so those don't work as you'd anticipate. You'll need to use <code class=\"language-text\">Shift+CTRL+C</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Shift+CTRL+V</code>. Because macOS uses CMD+C and CMD+V for copy and paste and those don't mean anything to bash, nothing changes for them.</li>\n<li>Be careful of what you copy and paste. If you copy something off a website, using JavaScript they can switch what you highlight with something more nefarious so that when you paste it, it doesn't do what you copied. So I could have copied <code class=\"language-text\">echo \"this is harmless\"</code> but it actually pastes <code class=\"language-text\">send_attacker_my_passwords</code>. Be careful that you trust where you're copying and pasting from (StackOverflow is fine!)</li>\n<li>Along with the former point, the attacker can actually even include the return character to execute the command before you can even see what it is. Most emulators (like Windows Terminal and iTerm2) will warn you \"hey, we found a return character in this paste, are you sure you meant to do this?\" but you shouldn't rely on the emulator to save you.</li>\n<li>In general it's just helpful to understand what you're doing. If you copy and paste something, make an effort to grasp what it's doing and how.</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"path":"/common-tips-and-tricks","title":"Common Tips and Tricks","order":"3B","section":"The CLI","description":"Brian talks about the common tips and tricks of the command line like what tilda means, how to find commands you previously ran, and other things to make your life on the command line"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9C","path":"/conditionals","title":"Conditionals"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"10C","path":"/conclusion","title":"Conclusion"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7D","path":"/curl","title":"curl"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3A","path":"/anatomy-of-a-cli-command","title":"Anatomy of a CLI Command"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6A","path":"/environments","title":"Environments"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"10A","path":"/cron","title":"cron"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"10D","path":"/errata","title":"Errata"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1A","path":"/intro","title":"Introduction"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9D","path":"/loops-and-arrays","title":"Loops and Arrays"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8B","path":"/apt","title":"APT"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4A","path":"/nano","title":"nano"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6D","path":"/process-operators","title":"Exit Codes, Process Operators, and Subcommands"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6B","path":"/processes","title":"Processes"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2C","path":"/lets-run-linux","title":"Let's Run Linux"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7B","path":"/sftp","title":"SFTP"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8C","path":"/snaps","title":"Snaps"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5A","path":"/interacting-with-files","title":"Interacting with Files"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"10B","path":"/customize-your-shell","title":"Customize Your Shell"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5C","path":"/streams-and-pipes","title":"Streams and Pipes"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9B","path":"/variables","title":"Variables"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3B","path":"/common-tips-and-tricks","title":"Common Tips and Tricks"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3C","path":"/signals-and-the-power-of-ctrl","title":"Signals and the Power of CTRL"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4B","path":"/vim","title":"vim"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2B","path":"/what-is-linux","title":"What is Linux"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5D","path":"/users-groups-and-permissions","title":"Users, Groups, and Permissions"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2A","path":"/what-will-you-learn","title":"What you will learn"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7C","path":"/wget","title":"wget"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5B","path":"/lol","title":"Wildcards and Replacements"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8A","path":"/what-is-package-management","title":"What is Package Management"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9A","path":"/writing-your-own-scripts","title":"Writing Your Own Scripts"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7A","path":"/ssh","title":"SSH"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},
