The objective of this course is teach you two principle concepts: what is Linux and why you'd use it, and how to use a command line. This two concepts I found were big barriers for developers getting started in their careers and I wanted to help demystify that. Throughout my career I've worked with developers who purposefully avoid the command line and I think that's a shame, you can do a lot of things quickly with just a bit of know-how.</p>\n<p>So today we'll cover the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is Linux</li>\n<li>What problems Linux solves for you</li>\n<li>How Linux is generally laid out</li>\n<li>What the command line is</li>\n<li>Basic navigation in the command line</li>\n<li>Common tasks with the command line</li>\n<li>Some basic customizations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope you'll come out the other side of this excited about what the command line and Linux can do for you!</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/what-will-you-learn","title":"What you will learn","order":"2A","section":"Linux","description":"It is always good to go in knowing what you're about to learn.
