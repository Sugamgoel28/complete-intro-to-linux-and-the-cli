It's up to the program to understand what to do with that. It's like if your friend sent you a text message that said \"come over.\" You (the program) are not obligated to do anything but the intent of the text is obvious, they (the user) want you to come over. The same applies here to programs. The good news is that generally everyone abides what's expected: if you send them a message to quit, they quit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ctrl--c--sigint\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#ctrl--c--sigint\" aria-label=\"ctrl  c  sigint permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>CTRL + C – SIGINT</h2>\n<p>If you hit CTRL + C while a program is running, you're telling it to <strong>int</strong>errupt what it's doing and stop. You'll use this constantly. One reason is some processes are designed to never quit until you send them a SIGINT to stop. A good example of that is the <code class=\"language-text\">yes</code> command. All <code class=\"language-text\">yes</code> does is spam the string \"y\" until you tell it to quit. A lazy programmer wrote it so it could automatically answer \"yes\" to all the prompts for interactive programs. (You can also say <code class=\"language-text\">yes n</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">yes whatever</code> and it'll spam whatever you want it to.)</p>\n<p>So go type <code class=\"language-text\">yes</code> into your terminal. You'll find yourself with an infinite wall of ever-spamming <code class=\"language-text\">y</code>s in front of you. To stop it, hit CTRL + C and it'll stop immediately.</p>\n<p>Another good use case is that you started running a command and you didn't mean to. You can send a SIGINT and start again.</p>\n<p>Again, some programs may not respect CTRL + C, and nearly all of them will take time to clean up after themselves when they do receive a SIGINT.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ctrl--d--sigquit\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#ctrl--d--sigquit\" aria-label=\"ctrl  d  sigquit permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>CTRL + D – SIGQUIT</h2>\n<p>Less useful but still good to know nonetheless is what CTRL + D does. Many programs won't respond to a SIGQUIT (some might, it's up to them) but bash itself will. If you're in a bash prompt and it want it to exit (like if you're remotely connected to a bash server for example), if you hit CTRL + D it'll tell the bash session to end. You also could close the window or just type <code class=\"language-text\">exit</code> and it'll exit too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sigterm\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sigterm\" aria-label=\"sigterm permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>SIGTERM</h2>\n<p>There is no shortcut for SIGTERM but I wanted to make sure you knew it existed. If I use the <code class=\"language-text\">kill</code> program to kill another program, the way it does that is by sending a SIGTERM to the program. The difference is that if the program doesn't exit, kill will still shut down the process. We'll talk later about <code class=\"language-text\">kill</code> but know it's there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sigkill\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#sigkill\" aria-label=\"sigkill permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>SIGKILL</h2>\n<p>If you want a program to stop and stop <strong>now</strong>, you can do <code class=\"language-text\">kill -9</code> (or <code class=\"language-text\">kill -SIGKILL</code>) and it will send the SIGKILL which means to the program \"don't clean up, just stop as soon as possible.)
